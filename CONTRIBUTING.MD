## Contributing to imcrypt
Hi thanks for taking time to contribute to this project please keep the following in mind-
1. Please me polite in the threads, comments.
2. Take pull from the main branch only.
3. Create the issue for the feature you want to work on, if already not created.
4. Please inform in the relevant issue thread that you intend to work on it and get the issue assigned to yourself.

## Branch Conventions
- Only one permanant branch - main branch, create branch from here and all pull requests are directed to it .
- Use a prefix like feature/Bug/WIP along with task - eg. feature/adding-contributing.md

Since this is a very small project adminstration should not be an issue feel free to tag @Priyanshu-001 in case of any problem.

PS: Feel free to suggest better contributing guidelines. Thanks!!
